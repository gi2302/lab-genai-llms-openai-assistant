        "\n",
        "Key concepts and skills covered:\n",
        "- **API Integration:** We combined two APIs—**Nominatim API** for geolocation and **Open-Meteo API** for weather data—to create a dynamic assistant.\n",
        "- **Error Handling:** We addressed potential errors, such as missing locations or API response issues, ensuring the assistant handles unexpected inputs gracefully.\n",
        "- **Data Processing:** We extracted and processed specific data points (like the current temperature) from complex JSON responses.\n",
        "- **Custom Headers:** To comply with API usage policies, we included custom headers in our requests, demonstrating best practices when interacting with public APIs.\n",
        "\n",
        "This exercise demonstrated how to create a powerful, real-world assistant that delivers personalized, location-based weather updates. These skills are essential for building practical applications in **Data Science** and **Software Development**.\n"
